# Financial Awareness Video – Google Flow

## Project Overview

This project is a short financial awareness video titled **“STOP SAVING. START INVESTING”**, created using **Google Flow (Free Version)**. The video uses a **single male presenter**, **Tamil voiceover**, and **visual storytelling** to explain the importance of investing over simple savings.

---

## Key Constraints

* Created using the **free version only** (no paid tokens)
* Very short default scene duration (~0.07 minutes)
* Limited control over subtitles and text rendering
* Tamil text rendering issues on screen
* Strict continuity required across scenes

---

## Challenges Faced

* Scene durations were heavily restricted, requiring compressed storytelling
* Auto-generated subtitles caused unwanted on-screen text
* Tamil fonts displayed inconsistently and were hard to read
* Maintaining the same presenter look, lighting, and camera angle across scenes
* Finance concepts had to be communicated **without using on-screen text**

---

## Creative Approach

* Removed all on-screen text (except final CTA)
* Used **visual metaphors** (piggy bank, plant growth, house, education, healthcare, retirement)
* Kept a **static camera**, clean background, and soft lighting
* Ensured seamless continuity by repeating presenter details in every scene

## Video Structure

1. **Scene 1** – Questioning the safety of savings
2. **Scene 2** – Low interest & value erosion (visual symbols only)
3. **Scene 3** – Power of consistent investing (growth visuals)
4. **Scene 4** – Future goals & assets (house, education, healthcare, retirement)
5. **Final Frame** – Strong English call-to-action
